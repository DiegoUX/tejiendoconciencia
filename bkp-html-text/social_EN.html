Our aim is to create awareness within society about the need of reducing plastic bag consumption and to offer tools to people so that they can find a useful resource in discarded material.

		<p><span class="capitol">W</span>e offer workshops to mixed groups of men and women of different ages and social classes, including children and teens. In the workshops we teach how to cut and crochet plastic bags.</p>
		<p>The workshops can occur once or they can be many meetings with each group, where we practice cutting and crocheting the plastic bags until a utilitarian product is finished. In addition, since 2013 we offer a free <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BibliotecaPopularLaRanda/?fref=ts">crochet workshop</a> where every interested person can learn the techniques and improve his/her products through time.</p>
		<p>Until now we have offered more than 15 workshops of different duration through which more than 150 people learnt how to crochet plastic bags, how to reduce their own trash, and how to transmit the message of responsible consumption.  As a result of these efforts, we organized the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IghfRbbuNA4&t=75s">first meeting of plastic crochet in Tucumán.</a></p>
